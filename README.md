This project focuses on the development of a responsive e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is designed to offer a seamless shopping experience across all devices, from desktop to mobile, by adapting to different screen sizes and ensuring a user-friendly interface.

HTML: Provides the structure and semantic layout for product listings, navigation menus, and checkout pages.
CSS: Styles the website to create an attractive, modern look and feel, utilizing flexbox, grid layout, and media queries to ensure responsiveness and proper alignment across devices.
JavaScript: Enhances interactivity by enabling dynamic features such as product filtering, image carousels, add-to-cart functionality, and real-time updates to the shopping cart.
Key features include:

A responsive design that adjusts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
Product catalog with filtering options (price, etc.).
Interactive user interfaces for a smooth shopping experience.
The project aims to provide an optimal and engaging experience for users, whether they're browsing on a mobile phone or shopping on a desktop computer.
